# Employee Tracker

## About
Using the command line, the user is prompted with a series of questions, allowing them to view and updated values in a database containing the tables: Employee, Role, and Department.  This application was made using MySQL, Node.js, Inquirer, and JavaScript.

## Usage
To begin, the user should run "npm i" to install all needed dependancies.  Then run "node server" to begin the inquirer prompts.  After each prompt the user is presented with a table showing their changes, or simply viewing the table they selected. When the user is done, they may select "Finished. End connection" from the prompts, and the application will close.
